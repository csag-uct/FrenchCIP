General notes:
- need to change links under fr nodes to link to other fr nodes (adding &lang=fr does not work)
- Graph titles need to be changed to french
- there are a few definitions on the english pages (when you hold mouse over word the definition comes up) these need to be changed to french for fr version
- under "cmip3-anomolies "and "cmip5-anomolies" there is a "more details" section; "more details" must be changed to french
